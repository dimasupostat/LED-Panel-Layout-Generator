# LED Panel Layout Generator

This web application allows you to generate a custom layout for LED panels, specifying the number of panels in width and height, and choosing the card layout (either 2x3 or 3x2). The generated layout is ready to be used with Draw.io for further customization.

## Features:
- **Customizable Layout**: Choose between `2x3` or `3x2` card layout configurations.
- **Colorful Panels**: Each panel has a unique pastel color for better visualization.
- **XML Generation**: Download the generated layout as an XML file compatible with Draw.io.

## How to Use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Input the number of panels you want in width and height.
3. Select the card layout (`2x3` or `3x2`).
4. Click **Generate and Download** to get the XML file for the layout.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: Structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout effects.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for generating the layout and the XML file.
